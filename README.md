# NFL Spread Classifier

A model built in PyTorch to classify the spread outcome for an NFL game (team 0/1 covers or push) using data from [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/nfl-elo-game) and [Spreadspoke](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tobycrabtree/nfl-scores-and-betting-data/data).

This project is mainly an exploration of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
